# Machine-Learning

Overview of the Project

In this notebook,  working on a classification project where the goal is to distinguish between rocks and mines based on sonar signals. The idea is to train a machine learning model that can predict whether a given sonar signal corresponds to a rock or a mine. You’re using a dataset where each row represents a different sonar signal, and the last column tells you whether it's a rock (R) or a mine (M).
numpy is for numerical operations, like handling arrays.
pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis. It’s especially great for working with tabular data like the one you have in a CSV file.
train_test_split helps you divide your data into a training set and a test set. This is important for evaluating how well your model is likely to perform on new data.
LogisticRegression is the algorithm you're using to build your classification model. Logistic regression is commonly used for binary classification tasks, which fits your problem of distinguishing between rocks and mines.
accuracy_score is a simple metric that will allow you to see how well your model is performing by calculating the percentage of correct predictions.

You load your dataset from a CSV file named sonar.csv using pandas. The header=None part tells pandas that the CSV file doesn’t have a header row, so it treats all rows as data. This dataset contains sonar readings, with each reading represented by a row of numerical values, and the label (either R or M) is in the last column.

sonar_data.shape gives you the dimensions of your dataset, i.e., the number of rows and columns.
sonar_data.describe() provides summary statistics, which are useful for understanding the distribution and range of values in each column.
sonar_data[60].value_counts() counts how many times each label (R or M) appears in your dataset. This helps you see if your classes are balanced or if one class is much more common than the other.

The stratify=Y parameter makes sure that both the training and testing sets have a similar proportion of rocks and mines. random_state=1 is just for consistency so that you get the same split every time you run the code.

You then create a logistic regression model and train it using the training data. The fit function is where the model learns from the training data, trying to find the best way to separate rocks from mines based on the sonar readings.
